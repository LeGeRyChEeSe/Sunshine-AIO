## Python3 Installation

- Download [Latest Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it on your computer.
	
- Add python to the Path when asked during the installation.


## Git Installation

- Download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it on your computer.

	> Dynamic pull of the repository and all the files on your local computer would be advantageous, as you can receive updates when they are available using the `git pull` command.

## Setup the repository

- Go in any location you want to put the folder in and open a terminal at this location.

Execute this command :

```batch
git clone --branch dev-AIO https://github.com/LeGeRyChEeSe/Sunshine-AIO.git
cd Sunshine-AIO
py -m venv virtualenv-python-sunshine-aio
virtualenv-python-sunshine-aio\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execute the AIO tool

- From the root folder of the repository (Sunshine-AIO), open a terminal and execute this command:

```batch
virtualenv-python-sunshine-aio\Scripts\python.exe src\main.py
```

> To execute the script, an elevated UAC prompt will appear and request `admin permission`.

- To finish the Playnite Watcher configuration, follow the instructions provided in the script.

## Update the repository

In order to receive new updates when I push new features, open a terminal and execute this command in the repository's root folder (Sunshine-AIO):

```git
git pull
```
Stay up-to-date !

## Troubleshooting

Please keep in mind this AIO tool is still in development and you may encounter bugs or issues when using it.

I may have also forgotten to implement some functions due to the fact that the script is at its very first version. I didnâ€™t test all the options that the script provides, because I wanted to provide a first version quickly so as to have your feedback and allow to progress faster than on my own. It works for me, but I suspect that it may not work at first for some of you.

Opening an issue at https://github.com/LeGeRyChEeSe/Sunshine-AIO/issues/new/choose is encouraged to receive initial help and improve the script.

Feel free to ask me any questions, so that I can one day provide the final version of the script to everyone.

Don't forget to configure your Moonlight client to connect to Sunshine and enjoy optimized streaming :)
