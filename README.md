## Troubleshooting

Please check the [opened issues](https://github.com/LeGeRyChEeSe/Sunshine-AIO/issues) before opening a new issue.

Make sure to configure your Moonlight client to connect to Sunshine and enjoy optimized streaming! ðŸŒž


## Build The Executable

- If you are afraid of the potential viruses in the `Sunshine-AIO.exe` (I 100% certify there are no viruses), you can build the executable yourself from this repo.

- Clone the repo with the `git clone https://github.com/LeGeRyChEeSe/Sunshine-AIO.git` command somewhere in a safe location and execute these commands:

> [!WARNING]
> Before trying to build the executable, make sure you have [Python](#python3-installation) and [Git](#git-installation) installed.

```batch
cd Sunshine-AIO
py -m venv venv
venv\Script\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd compiler
compile_executable.bat

```

- The executable should then appear in the `produced` folder next to the `compile_executable.bat` file.
