- ✅ Integration with existing menu system

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Third-party software warnings
- ✅ User consent management
- ✅ Integrity verification
- ✅ Installation path validation

### 5. Enhanced LibraryManager (`src/library/library_manager.py`)
**Status: ✅ Complete with Advanced Features**

**New Methods Added:**
```python
download_and_install_tool(tool_id, **kwargs) -> bool
get_tool_installation_status(tool_id) -> dict
uninstall_tool(tool_id) -> bool
update_tool_metadata(tool_id, metadata) -> bool
get_download_cache_info() -> dict
clear_download_cache(tool_id) -> bool
validate_tool_integrity(tool_id) -> bool
```

**Integration Features:**
- ✅ Complete workflow orchestration
- ✅ Component coordination (downloader + installer)
- ✅ Metadata management and caching
- ✅ Installation lifecycle tracking
- ✅ Cache management and optimization
